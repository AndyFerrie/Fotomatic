## My process

### What I learned

This is my first time converting pixels to rems. I learned about break points for different screen sizes. In the spec there was a cta button in the tablet sized site but the nav menu broke before reaching mobile dimensions so I used the mobile menu in the tablet size. When checking Codecademys final solution I see they did the same.

### Continued development

I need more practive with responsice design.
