## My process

### What I learned

This is my first time converting pixels to rems. I learned about break points for different screen sizes. In the spec there was a cta button in the tablet sized site but the nav menu broke before reaching mobile dimensions so I used the mobile menu in the tablet size. When checking Codecademys final solution I see they did the same.

Moreover, I had some trouble syncing from VS code to Github. I deleted the repository on Github and renamed the project folder but then whenever I opened the new folder it was trying to sync to the deleted repository. I learned that there is a hidden git folder that you need to delete and then you can create a new repository.

### Continued development

I need more practice with responsive design.
